# **THIS IS THE TUTORIEL WHERE WE WILL LEARN HOW TO USE BEST FORMATING STRING IN PYTHON**

## How to Use %-formatting

* String objects have a built-in operation using the % operator, which you can use to format strings. Here’s what that looks like in practice:
<br>
    <code >
        name = "Mahamadou kheraba"
        age  = 22
        "hello %s, you are %s year" % (name, age)
    </code>

## Why %-formatting Isn’t Great
 * once you start using several parameters and longer strings, your code will quickly become much less easily readable. Things are starting to look a little messy already:
 <br>
<code>
    fristname = "Mahamadou"
    secondname = "kheraba"
    lastname = "diaby"
    age  = 22
    sexe = "Male"
    profession = "developer"
    "hello %s %s %s, you are %s year, sexe %s. You are %s. " % (fristname, secondname, lastname, age, sexe, profession)
</code>

## How To Use str.format()
* str.format() is improvement on %-formating
<br>
<code>
    name = "Mahamadou kheraba"
    age  = 22
    "hello {}, you are {} year".format(name, age)
</code>

* You can reference variables in any order by referencing their index:
<br>
<code>
    name = "Mahamadou kheraba"
    age  = 22
    "hello {0}, you are {1} year".format(name, age)
</code>

* But if you insert the variable names, you get the added perk of being able to pass objects and then reference parameters and methods in between the braces:
<br>
<code>
    person = {'name': 'Mahamadou kheraba', 'age': '22'}
    "hello {name}, you are {age} year".format(name=person[name], age=person[age])
</code>

* You can also use ** to do this neat trick with dictionaries:
<br>
<code>
    person = {'name': 'Mahamadou kheraba', 'age': '22'}
    "hello {name}, you are {age} year".format(**person)
</code>

## Why str.format() Isn’t Great
* str.format() can still be quite verbose when you are dealing with multiple parameters and longer strings. Take a look at this
<br>
<code>
    fristname = "Mahamadou"
    secondname = "kheraba"
    lastname = "diaby"
    age  = 22
    sexe = "Male"
    profession = "developer"
    "hello {fristname} {secondname} {lastname}, you are {age} year,sexe {sexe}. You are {profession}. ".format(fristname=fristname, secondname=secondname, lastname=lastname, age=age, sexe=sexe, profession=profession)
</code>

## f-Strings: A New and Improved Way to Format Strings in Python

 Also called “formatted string literals,” f-strings are string literals that have an f at the beginning and curly braces containing expressions that will be replaced with their values

* Here are some of the ways f-strings can make your life easier.
<br>
<code>
    name = "Mahamadou kheraba"
    age  = 22
    f"hello {name}, you are {age} year"
</code>

* It would also be valid to use a capital letter F:
<br>
<code>
    name = "Mahamadou kheraba"
    age  = 22
    F"hello {name}, you are {age} year"
</code>

* f-strings are evaluated at runtime,  you can put any and all valid Python expressions in them. This allows you to do some nifty things
<br>
<code>
    f"{2*3}"
</code>
<br>
<code>
    name = "mahamadou kheraba"
    age  = 22
    f"hello {name.lower()}, you are {age.lower()} year"
</code>
